My contrabution to this project was:
1. Creating the menu system. This includes the main menu, map selection, skin store/selection and options menu.
2. Implementing the methods that loaded the maps to be played using asynchronous methods.
3. Creating the save system to store the players BirdCoin and bought skins between sessions.
4. Implementing the methods to use the selected skin in the game
5. Adding music and sound effects to the game (all royalty free)
6. Defining unit tests to ensure game quality. This also included running the tests frequently and fixing any bugs that were discovered.
